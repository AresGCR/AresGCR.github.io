# Individual Leetcode: Permutations
Permutations of an array refer to all possible arrangements of the elements of the array in different orders. Given an array of distinct integers, the goal is to general all the possible permutations of the array.  

For an array of length n , there are n! Possible permutations and the factorial of a non-negative integer is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n 

The solution used is the Backtracking approach that involves a recursive algorithm that builds permutations one element at a time and explores all potential permutations. 

Another solution used is the Iterative approach that used Heapâ€™s Algorithm that minimizes the number of swaps needed to generate the permutation.
