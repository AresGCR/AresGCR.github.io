# WEEK III
This week I attended the onboarding sessions left. It was a few sessions, I think it was because the To do work for this week is relative more than the past weeks. I really enjoyed coding for this week and I enjoyed it more that it were complex problems.
I used backtracking for my individual LeetCode problem. It was a challenge and I felt relieved to use backtracking again.
For the team LeetCode problem "Patchin Array" I used a greedy algorithm for solving it and it was a really complex challenge because I have to dig up my nose at the Cormell Algorithm's book.
