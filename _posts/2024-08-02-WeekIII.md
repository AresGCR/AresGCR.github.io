# Week III at the Spark Program
This week I attended the onboarding sessions left and started working on the to-do assignments.
The tasks I focused first were the LeetCode problems due to the complexity of the problems and the indicated specifications. 

Using a new language to code as Golang was a little bit of a challenge but the real challenge was to understand the team problem and search for an optimized solution. My firsts approaches were unsuccessful and took me more time than I expected but at the end I came to the optimized solution by learning about the **greedy approach.** `See Patching Array technical log in this blog`


The other LeetCode problem I came to the solution by using recursion by the elegant use of the backtracking approach using Python. `See Permutation technical log in this blog`

Finally but not least, I really wanted to do a really cool blog I could edit everything I want so I chose  Github Pages to accomplish that but it took me a lot of time to get immersed on the documentation of Github pages.

I really enjoyed the to-do tasks and I am waiting for the feedback.
