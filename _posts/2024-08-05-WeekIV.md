# Week IV at Spark program

This week I invested most of time on an investigation for developing the to-do task. It is an application server, running on different ports.
Learning about the front-end framework for developing it consumed many days and after a couple of days I realized that I needed to develop first the back-end.

The rest of the week I started to develop the back-end for the application and in the beginning of the next week it should be done.

Keep an eye on my future posts!
