# Week VI at Spark program


This week I worked a lot on the front end development of my application and it was exhausting. 

My lack of experience in the applicaton development with a front end language programs got me in many troubles and in a waste of time because I didn't know React is a library and all the dependencies it has.

Learning Javascript with React, HTML and CSS, all in one, was a hell of a bit of a challenge but I really felt very pleased because I understood most of the tutorials so I could write code, undersanting most of it. 

Although I couldn't finish all the specifications for being a thorough person on the development of the app I gained a lot of knowledge so I could applied it later. 

And that's all folks!
