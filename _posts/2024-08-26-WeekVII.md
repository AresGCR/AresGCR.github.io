# Week VII at Spark program

This week I was dealing with the Breakable Toy II and it is one hell of a challenge!

First, I decided to grasp the general idea of how the backend is going to be implemented before starting developing and writing code. I got the idea but then I started to think in many issues arrising on how to get the information from Amadeus, like how to save the HTTP requets GET method and if i can save it in a JSON file etc.

Then, I realized I was making a big deal out of nothing so I started making API calls using the HTTPRequest library from java and started transforming the requests etc. and storing in another class.

Now, I have doubts about the implementation becasue someone in the last check-out mentioned the DAO pattern but I don't really know if it fits well because we are not using a database. Hope my mentor could guide me through this doubts to create a good backend for the application.


Bit by bit, I grasp the idea to develop the backend from the information obtained from the API and at the same time  I learn a lot on how applications are made! 

That's all by now! This week seems to be very though but with the help from my mentor hope it will be a little bit easy! 

See u next week!
