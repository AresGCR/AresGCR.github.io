# Week VIII at Spark program

This week I was also dealing with the Breakable Toy II and it was kind of frustrating most of the week because the Amadeus API is still not avialable to retrive information and this information is neccesary to develop the application because we need it to display it  in the frontend but I saved some request I fetched doing some testing and this helped not only me but some members of my batch and I felt pleased that I also helped them!

After everyone in the Spark verified the API is not available I started coding the front end and it was kind of relaxing to little by little building this project and because I used many of the resources learned from the Breakable Toy I,  it made me feel so pleased and I developed very fast the application for all the insight learned!

Finally, I refactorize my backend code  to use my mockdata and not the API. I achieved this by parsing the JSON archive but one issue that bothersme is that I don't kwow if the  the functions that uses the API work well because there is no way to verify this. Hope it works well! 


And that's everything I been doing and I think it was kind of like a journey!


See u next week!
