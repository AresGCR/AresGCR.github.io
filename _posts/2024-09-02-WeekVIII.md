# Week VIII at Spark program

This week I was also dealing with the Breakable Toy II and it was kind of frustrating most of the week because the Amadeus API is still not avialable to retrive information and this information is neccesary to develop the application because we need it to display it  in the frontend but I saved some request I fetched doing some testing and this helped not only me but some members of my batch and I felt pleased that I also helped them!

After everyone in my batch verified the API is not available , I started coding the front end and it was kind of relaxing to little by little build this project because I used many of the resources I learned from the Breakable Toy I. I felt so pleased that I gained so much knowledge from the past Brekable Toy and I could develop more fast and more efficient this new Breakable Toy!! 

Finally, I refactorize my backend code  to use my mockdata and not the API because the due dates from this Breakable Toy could not be postpone. This was new for me because I never used the gson tool but I learned real quick and in no time I was able to retrieve data from the json file but one issue that bother's me is that I don't kwow if the  the functions that use the Amadeus API work well because there is no way to be sure, not until the Amadeus API starts working.


And that's everything I did the last week, it was and still is a journey that gives me insight and knowledge of my capabailities!


See u next week!
