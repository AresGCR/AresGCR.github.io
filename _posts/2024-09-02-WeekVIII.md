# Week VIII at Spark program

This week I was also dealing with the Breakable Toy II and it was kind of frustrating most of the times because the Amadeus API is not avialable to retrive information but I saved some data from my previous explorations with the API.

After everyone in the Spark said the API is not available I started coding the front end and it was kind of relaxing to little by little building this project. I used many of the resources learned from the Breakable Toy I and it made me feel so pleased because all the time I invested on learning all about the front end paid so well!

Then, I refactorize my backend to use my mockdata and not the API. I hope it works my functions that call the API in the demo. That is one thing that worries me but I hope everthing will be all right!


See u next week!
