# Week IX at Spark program

This week, I was algo working in the `Breakable Toy II` eventhough the due date was on Monday, this was because the Amadeus API got restablished on Thursday and the live demo from the project is going to be on Monday 9th. I was focused on the complexities of transitioning from using mock data to making real API calls within the  application . The shift introduced significant changes in both the frontend and backend, highlighting important differences between mock services and live APIs. Although using `MockAmadeusApiService` during development helped streamline testing, working with `AmadeusApiService`to make real Amadeus API calls brought new challenges that required me to rethink various aspects of the project.

## Struggles with Backend API Integration: Mock Data vs. Real Amadeus API Calls

When working with the `MockAmadeusApiService`, I initially appreciated the simplicity and control it provided. Mock data allowed me to simulate predictable responses, making it easier to develop without worrying about  unexpected data structures and blank responses. However, as I transitioned to making real API calls to the Amadeus API, I quickly realized that dealing with live data was far more complex.

Unlike mock data, real Amadeus API responses introduced issues like generating the token to let fetching data and generating  dynamic urls for fetching specific data. The parsing and gson issues was already handled in the `MockAmadeusApiService` but I had to implement it `AmadeusApiService` the same way.

## Frontend Adjustments: Mock Data vs. Real Amadeus API Responses

On the frontend, the difference between using mock data and making real API calls was equally striking. With mock data, I had full control over what the frontend received, allowing for faster iterations and easier debugging. But once I started using live Amadeus API responses, I encountered new challenges, such as handling the user request.

Additionally, real Amadeus API calls required more sophisticated state management. While working with `MockAmadeusApiService` ,the mock service did not provide static data for the dynamic search for the IATA codes and implementing in dynamic live data , lead to potential changes in the response structure. This forced me to implement more robust type definitions and error-checking mechanisms in TypeScript, ensuring the frontend could handle unexpected or incomplete data gracefully.

## Connection Between Frontend and Backend


One of the biggest challenges during the development process was managing the user requests from the frontend and ensuring that the backend handled them properly, particularly when it came to differentiating between one way trips and roundtrips. While mock data allowed for simplified assumptions (only one-way trips), working with real user input and live Amadeus API calls introduced new complexities that required a more thoughtful approach.

The difficulty stemmed from the need to capture different types of user requests in the frontend whether they were booking a one-way trip or a roundtrip and pass that information seamlessly to the backend for processing. Initially, when using the MockAmadeusApiService, the one-way trip type,the backend always knew what to expect. However, when working with real API calls and dynamic user inputs, the backend had to be prepared to handle both scenarios.
On the frontend, the main challenge was ensuring that the user's choice—whether they were booking a one-way trip or roundtrip—was captured correctly and passed to the backend in a consistent format. This required clear state management and validation to make sure that incomplete or invalid requests were not sent.

For example, in the case of a roundtrip, the user needed to select both departure and return dates and on the other hand, a one-way trip required only a departure date, and the frontend not only had to adapt to this difference in a way that felt intuitive to the user but to handle this information to make the right petition to the backend.

On the backend, the complexity lay in interpreting the user's request accurately and preparing the API call accordingly. The Amadeus API expects different parameters for one-way and roundtrip bookings. For one-way trips, only a single departure location ,date and nonStop flag  need to be processed. However, for roundtrip requests, additional data like the return date.

To handle this, I had to modify the backend logic to dynamically adjust the API parameters based on the request type. If the request was for a one-way trip, the backend would generate the API call with the minimal required fields. For roundtrip requests, the backend would include the necessary return flight details. Failure to do this correctly would result in the API returning errors or, worse, incomplete or incorrect flight options for the user.

## Personal Growth and Future Outlook

This week’s challenges taught me valuable lessons about the differences between mock data and real API calls. While mock services like the `MockAmadeusApiService` offer a controlled environment for development, they don’t fully simulate the complexities of working with real-world APIs. Moving forward, I plan to take a more proactive approach to error handling and performance optimization, anticipating the challenges that live APIs bring.

By working through these issues, I gained a deeper understanding of how to build better systems that can handle both the controlled environment of mock data and the unpredictability of live API responses. I now feel better equipped to manage future projects that involve complex API integrations.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, transitioning from mock data to real Amadeus API calls in the applicationt was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The process forced me to confront the realities of working with live data and pushed me to improve both my frontend and backend development skills. While mock services are a valuable tool for testing, real API calls introduce a level of complexity that requires careful planning and robust error management. I am now more confident in handling both mock data and live API interactions, better preparing me for future projects.
