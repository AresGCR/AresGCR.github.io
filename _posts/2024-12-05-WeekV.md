# Week V at Spark program

This week I invested most of time on the back-end development for the application. It has been a pleasure to apply many knowledge  I acquired during my time at college. 

When I was in computer networks I learned about the request methods but I don't really dive in too much on what could I accomplish with those request methods. Now, I am using those with POSTMAN application and, because I never used those methods like that, I find them really helpful to test the back-end development.

It is worth mention I had the pleasure of meeting my mentor. I had a good talk with him and I am really looking forward to work with him on this jungle we call the software development industry.

Now, I am using my time to develop the front-end for the application and everything is going as planned!
